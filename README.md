## Alpha Release
The alpha release that is currently public is the first ever version released to the public! There are a lot of features missing and will probably be a lot of bugs, make sure to report any bugs in the Issues tab on this repository!

From this repository you can download the .apk file to install Meower onto an Android phone and the source code (.aia) file which can be loaded in Kodular (https://creator.kodular.io/)

## Note when installing
When installing the .apk file from this repository you may get alerts from Google Play Protect! This is due to the app not being signed yet, it will be signed shortly once we get all the details ready to be able to sign.
