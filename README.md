# MeowerMobile
The official source-code for the Meower mobile client.

## Alpha Release
The version that is currently live on GitHub is the last 0.x version of Mewoer Mobile and is likely the last one before Meower rewrite. Support will not be given for the current client, it's only for people who really need Meower on Android. It doesn't have very many features and has some bugs.

From this repository you can download the .apk file to install Meower onto an Android phone and the source code (.aia) file which can be loaded in Kodular (https://creator.kodular.io/)

## Note when installing
When installing the .apk file from this repository you may get alerts from Google Play Protect! This is due to the app not being signed yet, it will be signed shortly once we get all the details ready to be able to sign.
