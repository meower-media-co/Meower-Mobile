# MeowerMobile
The official source-code for the Meower mobile client.

## Alpha Release
Currently Meower Mobile is unavailable to use! This is due to a lot of features being updated in Beta 5, I am trying to get Mobile 0.5 working as soon as I can.

From this repository you can download the .apk file to install Meower onto an Android phone and the source code (.aia) file which can be loaded in Kodular (https://creator.kodular.io/)

See this spreadsheet for tested devices and Android versions: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otJu5ldjapSFbOvq3QAWSwFpRmQuhj6y/


## Note when installing
When installing the .apk file from this repository you may get alerts from Google Play Protect! This is due to the app not being signed yet, it will be signed shortly once we get all the details ready to be able to sign.
