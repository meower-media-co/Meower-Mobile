            <h2 style="color:orange;">Meower Rewrite</h2>
            <p>As some of you may know, Meower is gonna be fully rewritten soon and move away from Scratch. Trust me, it's for the better. On this page I explain what the future plans are for Meower and more specifically Meower Mobile.</p>
            <h4 style="color: orange">The final build of Meower Mobile v0.x</h4>
            <p>The final build of Meower Mobile as we've come to know over the last few months is now live on GitHub. The GitHub repository has been archived temporarily while we make a new Mobile client for "new Meower".<br>No one will be responding to any issues with Meower Mobile and development will be haulted until after Meower rewrite.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="color: orange">The future of Meower</h4>
            <p>Meower is beginning a full rewrite of Meower, with better focus on communities, communication and privacy.<br>The new version of Meower Vanilla be gonna be built in Vue and instead of using WebSockets for the backend, it'll mainly use an API built in Node and a WebSocket that will just alerts clients of certain things.<br>You can find out more about this rewrite by joining the Meower Media Co. Discord <a href="https://discord.gg/G5dMpr4dvH">here</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="color: orange">The future of Meower Mobile</h4>
            <p>Once the new version of Meower Vanilla and the API has been built, Meower Mobile will be rebuilt using React Native.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 style="color: orange">Concept for new Meower</h4>
            <p>Here is the concept design made by William Horning which the Meower team will be developing off of. (Meower Vanilla)</p>
